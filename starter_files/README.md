# Operationalizing Machine Learning(Training-Deploying-Consuming ML Models using Azure Machine Learning)

## Overview
In this project, we demonstrated end-to-end ML. i.e. we used Microsoft Azure to configure and create a model, deploy it and consume it, also we create, publish and consume a pipeline. The main aim of this project was to learn about operationalizing machine learning by deploying model so that we get an endpoint URL that can easily be accessible by end-user.

Main steps performed in the project are:
1. Creating Automated ML model
1. Deploy the model(Creating cluster configuration and compute targets and get models into production.)
1. Consuming an endpoint(Consume endpoints to interact with a deployed model in Azure ML Studio.)
1. Pipeline automation

## Dataset

The dataset contains data about the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The goal is to use classification to predict if the client will subscribe(0/1) to a term deposit(target variable y).

__Input Variables:__ age, job(type of job), marital(marital status), education etc.

**Predict Variable(desired target):** y - Has the client subscribe to a term deposit? (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
